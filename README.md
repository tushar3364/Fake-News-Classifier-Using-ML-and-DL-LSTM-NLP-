# Fake-News-Classifier-Using-ML-and-DL-LSTM-NLP-

### Fake News Classification is an essential task in today's information-driven world. 
### We have to build a model to classify news articles as reliable or potentially unreliable based on the given dataset.
**train.csv** : A full training dataset with the following attributes:

**id**: unique id for a news article                                            
**title**: the title of a news article                              
**author**: author of the news article                                             
**text**: the text of the article; could be incomplete                                            
**label**: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable                                     
1: unreliable , 0: reliable

**test.csv**: A full dataset without label, on which prediction is to be done by building a highly accurate healthy model.

The Steps involved are :

1. Importing Libraries and Data to be used                                                         
2. Data Preprocessing                                          
3. Model Selection and Evaluation                                            
4. Predictions on Test Data
